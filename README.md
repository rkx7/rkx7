# RK7: Rayyan Khan (15)
I'm an engineer and programmer with a vision to become the next humble tech-monopoly. The current state of technology is a mess, as people fight for greed and money, often harming consumers in the process. 

# Al-Quwwah
My goal with this company is to create technology that comes as close to perfection as possible without exploiting people's money. We aim to develop open-source technology, including electronics, driven by passion rather than profit. Our focus includes the following areas:
- Electric (GREEN) cars
- Semiconductor manufacturing (Lithography)
- Conductor/component manufacturing (High-quality capacitors/low-tolerance resistors, etc.)
- Laptops/phones/electronics
- AC electrical hardware (Socket faces/switches, etc.)
- Wire manufacturing
- Home design

# Why am I doing this?
I know some may say that I'm reinventing the wheel, but I believe in rebuilding all technology with consistency and quality. <br />
**ADHD**<br />
I have been diagnosed with ADHD since I was 10 years old, which has caused me to experience common issues such as task switching, constant dissatisfaction, anger issues, and impulsive lying. Despite these challenges, my ADHD has also quadrupled my passion for electronics and curiosity for how things work, including atoms and human cells. However, ADHD has also caused my grades to drop, and I wish that schools were more inclusive for neurodivergent people by teaching them at a faster pace, given that ADHD causes pain from lack of patience. 

# Al-Quwwah Connect [NET]
Another project we aim to add to the world is Al-Quwwah Connect [NET], which aims to replace the current internet completely. This network will support multilingual addresses, high network security to prevent poor router attacks, a centralized ISP, and little to no scams, illegal content, and proper NSFW blocking to keep children safe. 

# What do we want to do with any extra money?
- Engineer high-end construction equipment
- Build a suburban city with no cracked roads, ugly sewers, smoky smells, and a lack of trees. A city where housing is reasonably priced but feels absolutely luxurious.
