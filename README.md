# RK7: Rayyan Khan (15)
Engineer and Programmer trying to become the next humble tech-monopoly. Current technology is a mess, people fight for greed money and harm their consumers. 

# Fonyx: Fractal Onyx
My goal with this company is to make the closest thing to perfection without eating peoples money. I want all technology to be open-source including electronics, and built for a passion.
We want to work on everything and beyond the following.
 - Electric (GREEN) Cars
 - Semiconductor Manufacturing (Lithography)
 - Conductor/Component Manufacturing [High Quality Capasitors/Low Tolerance Resistors/Etc...]
 - Laptops/Phones/Electronics
 - AC Electrical Hardware [Socket Faces/Switches/Etc...]
 - Wire Manufacturing
 - Home Design
 
# Why am I doing this?
I know many will say im reinventing the rounded wheel ever, which would be correct, I'm trying to rebuild all technology with consistancy and quality. <br />
**ADHD**<br />
I have been diagnosed with ADHD since 10 years old. Due to this, I have experienced the following common issues.
 - Task switching issues.
 - Constant disatifaction
 - Anger issues
 - Impulsive lying
<br />
While having ADHD has more than quadrupled my passion for electronics and curiosity for how even atoms, humans cells replicate, why atoms have forces, etc... ADHD does have some drawbacks such as my grades dropping.
I wish school was just more inclusive for neurodivergent people by teaching them faster since ADHD's major effects is pain from patience to the point where I ended up learning calculus my self rather than waiting for the grade.
 
# Fonyx Connect [NET]

This network will support multilingual addresses, high network security without poor router attacks, a centeralized ISP, and little to no scams, illegal content, proper NSFW blocking to keep modern children safe. 
 
# What do we want to do with any extra money?
 - Engineer high end construction equpiment
 - Build a suburban city that doesn't have cracked roads, ugly sewers, smoky smells, lack of trees. A city where housing is reasonable priced but feels absolutly luxurious.
